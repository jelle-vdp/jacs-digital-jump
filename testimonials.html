                        <h3>John Smith - Locksmith</h3>
                        <q>It's well known to all in the locksmith industry that the competition is pretty rough. I was already aware that a website was a necessity but on top of that your customers also need to find you on websites such as Google. How to do that? I had absolutely no clue. A friend of mine recommended me JACS and they truly delivered. They started off with building me a beautiful website. Then they set up tools like Google My Business and put some advertisements on Google Ads. As soon as the SEO rankings of my website rose I had to spend less and less on paying ads. All of this wouldn't be possible without the help of the team of JACS. Thanks!</q>

                        <h3>Frank De Tank - Plumber</h3>
                        <q>Back in the good ol' days I would get customers from all over Antwerp thanks to the magical Gele Gids phonebook. But during the second half of the 2000's it was clear that this business model wasn't working anymore. A website had to be the solution. So we hired a company to make one for us. After a while we found out they were total frauds. Sure, the website looked nice but no one found us on search engines like Google and Yahoo. At this time I was totally depressed, started using heroin and prostituted myself out, just to keep my plumbing business afloat. Now, thanks to the incredible team of JACS my business is flourishing again. Due to a nice combination of SEO, SEA and ofcourse a beautiful, user-friendly website I get calls from all over Flanders. I'm no longer high on smack, I'm high on plumbing! Thanks so much to Snehal, Andy, Jelle and Cédric for their patience and their efforts to make my business succesfull again.</q>

                        <h3>Robert Smith - Guitar shop owner</h3>
                        <q>Who likes to rock the party? Robert Smith likes to rock the party! I've been in the guitar business for over 30 years and sure, at some point in the 2005 I decided it was time for a website. But we've come a long way since. By the mid 2010's the website looked awfully outdated and didn't even work on mobile phones. In 2020, during the whole Corona shitstorm, I decided it was time for a new, fresh looking website with a built-in webshop. This proved to be the ideal solution because I lost a lot of my income during the lockdowns. Now all my customers can order their favourite guitars, accessoires, etc. straight from their mobile phone. I love it! Thanks JACS, you truly delivered!</q>
